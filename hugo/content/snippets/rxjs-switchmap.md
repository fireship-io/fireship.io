`switchMap` is one of the most useful RxJS operators because it can compose Observables from an initial value that is unknown or that change. Conceptually, it is similar to chaining `then` functions with Promises, but operates on streams (Promises resolve once). 

{{% box icon="abacus" %}}
Example: You have an Observable of a userID, then use it to *switch* to an HTTP request of all posts owned by that user. 
{{% /box %}}


{{< file "js" "foo.js" >}}
{{< highlight javascript >}}
import { of } form 'rxjs'; // creates an Observable with a raw value
import { switchMap } form 'rxjs/operators';


const user$ = of({ userID: 'jeffd23' });

const boats$ = $user.pipe(
    switchMap(user => {
        // return an Observable or Promise here
        return fetch(`http://.../boats/${user.userID}`)
    })
)

boats$.subscribe(console.log);
// Logs response from the API
{{< /highlight >}}

Notice how we only need to subscribe to the `boats$` Observable. It will automatically subscribe to the `$user`, then use the emitted userID to create the final observable of boats.
