The following snippet demonstrates how to use the [Firestore emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup) in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Setting up the emulator allows you to create mock data on your local system during development. In some cases, this can eliminate the need for switching between dev/prod firebase projects when building your app. 

ðŸ”¥ Watch the [advanced emulator tutorial](/lessons/firebase-emulator-advanced/) for additional tips and tricks on this subject. 

## Setup the Emulator Suite

Initialize the emulator suite. Select the options for emulators & firestore when prompted, then stick with the defaults for everything else. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
firebase init
# Choose emulators, then firestore when prompted

firebase emulators:start
```

Starting the emulator should give you access to the UI on `localhost:4000`.

## Connect Flutter to the Firestore Emulator

The Firestore emulator instance is running on `localhost:8080`. We can tell Flutter to use the emulator by modifying the settings after our widgets have been initialized. On an Android emulator, you must point to the IP `10.0.2.2` to connect to the 'localhost'. 

{{< file "flutter" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import 'dart:io' show Platform;

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {

  @override
  void initState() {
    String host = Platform.isAndroid ? '10.0.2.2:8080' : 'localhost:8080';

    FirebaseFirestore.instance.settings = Settings(host: host, sslEnabled: false);


    super.initState();
  }

}
```

That's it! Your app will now use the local emulated database values instead of your real production data in the cloud. You might improve this code by using environment variables or [flavors](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/flavors) to only use the emulator when running a development build.
