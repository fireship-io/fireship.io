Social media and chat apps (think Slack, Facebook Messenger, etc) often have presence detection systems that can indicate if your friends are **online, offline, or away**. Traditionally, features like this have been challenging because you need manage state between the client & server, but the Firebase [RealtimeDB](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) makes it easy. The following lesson will show you how to build a realtime user presence system with Angular and Firebase.

## Step 0: Prerequisites

This post first appeared as [Episode 41 on AngularFirebase.com](https://angularfirebase.com/lessons/user-presenece-system-in-realtime/) and has been fully updated with the latest best practices.

1. {{< prereq "install-angularfire" >}}
1. You should have a working user auth system in place. Most of the relevant code for the auth service is shown below, however I recommend following [Firebase Authentication System](https://fireship.io/lessons/angularfire-google-oauth/) lesson first. 

## Step 1: Listen to the Realtime DB Connection

{{< box icon="fire" class="box-orange" >}}
Realtime presence is not directly supported in Firestore, but it is possible to mirror the RealtimeDB data with a Cloud Function using this [official guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/solutions/presence). Personally, I find the setup to be quite cumbersome and recommend using RealtimeDB directly - at least until Firestore supports an **onDisconnect** hook.

There are at least five distinct states that need to be addressed. Keep in mind, you may find additional edge cases beyond these. 

1. Signed-in and using app (online ðŸ’š)
2. Signed-in but app is closed (offline ðŸ”´)
3. Signed-in but on a different browser tab (away ðŸ’¤)
4. Signed-out but app is still opened (offline ðŸ”´)
5. Signed-out and app closed (offline ðŸ”´)

In the database, we keep track of a user's presence under a the **status/{uid}/** node. 

{{< figure src="img/rtdb-presence.png" alt="realtime database model for presence system" >}}

In Angular, let's start by generating a service to handle the business logic for presence detection. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
{{< highlight text >}}
ng g service presence
{{< /highlight >}}

### Base Service

Our service will start by implementing a series of helpers aimed at making our code composable and readable. Here's a breakdown of each method so far. 

- `getPresence` retrieves the presence data from DB as an Observable.
- `getUser` returns the current user as a Promise.
- `setPresence` updates the DB with a new presence value. 
- `timestamp` getter for the Firebase server timestamp.  

Also, notice how we are setting up a few subscriptions in the constructor - these will be implemented in the following sections and they are responsible for updating the user's status reactively. 

{{< file "ngts" "foo.component.ts" >}}
{{< highlight typescript >}}
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { AngularFireAuth } from '@angular/fire/auth';
import { AngularFireDatabase } from '@angular/fire/database';
import * as firebase from 'firebase/app';
import { tap, map, switchMap, first } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { TouchSequence } from 'selenium-webdriver';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class PresenceService {

  constructor(private afAuth: AngularFireAuth, private db: AngularFireDatabase) {
    console.log('let there be presence');
    this.updateOnUser().subscribe();
    this.updateOnDisconnect().subscribe();
    this.updateOnAway();
  }

  
  getPresence(uid: string) {
    return this.db.object(`status/${uid}`).valueChanges();
  }

  getUser() {
    return this.afAuth.authState.pipe(first()).toPromise();
  }


 async setPresence(status: string) {
    const user = await this.getUser();
    if (user) {
      return this.db.object(`status/${user.uid}`).update({ status, timestamp: this.timestamp });
    }
  }

  get timestamp() {
    return firebase.database.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP;
  }

  // Implement presence logic here

}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Online Status ðŸ’š


The code below takes care of the *online* status. When the user logs in or opens the app, it will switchMap to an Observable of the database connection, then update the logged-in user's presence. 

{{< file "ngts" "presence.service.ts" >}}
{{< highlight typescript >}}
// Updates status when logged-in connection to Firebase starts
 updateOnUser() {
    const connection = this.db.object('.info/connected').valueChanges().pipe(
      map(connected => connected ? 'online' : 'offline')
    );

    return this.afAuth.authState.pipe(
      switchMap(user =>  user ? connection : of('offline')),
      tap(status => this.setPresence(status))
    );
  }
{{< /highlight >}}

### Offline Status ðŸ”´

The offline status is dependent on the `onDisconnect` hook, which will run an update when the database connection is lost. Also, the app's signOut handler should update the status because the database connection may still be active after the user logs out. 

{{< file "ngts" "presence.service.ts" >}}
{{< highlight typescript >}}
  updateOnDisconnect() {
    return this.afAuth.authState.pipe(
      tap(user => {
        if (user) {
          this.db.object(`status/${user.uid}`).query.ref.onDisconnect()
            .update({
              status: 'offline',
              timestamp: this.timestamp
          });
        }
      })
    );
  }

async signOut() {
    await this.setPresence('offline');
    await this.afAuth.signOut();
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Away or Idle Status ðŸ’¤

The away status is completely optional, but it does add a nice touch. We check if the app's browser tab is open using the [Page Visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API). 

Keep in mind, we are touching the DOM directly here, so this code will not work with server-side rendering or other non-web platforms. 

{{< file "ngts" "presence.service.ts" >}}
{{< highlight typescript >}}
  // User navigates to a new tab, case 3
  updateOnAway() {
    document.onvisibilitychange = (e) => {

      if (document.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
        this.setPresence('away');
      } else {
        this.setPresence('online');
      }
    };
  }
{{< /highlight >}}


## Step 2: Show the Status in the UI

At this point, we have all the business logic in place for realtime presence. Let's create a component that will consume the data from the RealtimeDB. 
{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
{{< highlight text >}}
ng g component user-status
{{< /highlight >}}

### Listen to Presence Updates Globally

In most cases, you should start tracking user presence as soon as your app starts. In Angular, we can achieve this by injecting the service in the AppComponent constructor.

{{< file "ngts" "app.component.ts" >}}
{{< highlight typescript >}}
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(public presence: PresenceService) {}
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### User Status Component

The component takes a UID as an input property, then uses it to read the database.


{{< file "ngts" "user-status.component.ts" >}}
{{< highlight typescript >}}
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { PresenceService } from '../services/presence.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-status',
  templateUrl: './user.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./user.component.scss']
})
export class UserStatusComponent implements OnInit {

  @Input() uid;

  presence$;

  constructor(private presence: PresenceService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.presence$ = this.presence.getPresence(this.uid);
  }

}

{{< /highlight >}}


The HTML can use [NgClass](https://angular.io/api/common/NgClass) to conditionally display a green, yellow, or red label based on the presence Observable.  Note: the CSS classes below come from [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/syntax/), so make sure to replace them with your own styles. 

{{< file "html" "foo.component.html" >}}
{{< highlight html >}}
<div *ngIf="presence$ | async as presence" class="tag is-large" 
      [ngClass]="{
          'is-success':  presence.status  === 'online',
          'is-warning': presence.status  === 'away',
          'is-danger':  presence.status  === 'offline'
      }"
>

  {{ presence.status }}
</div>
{{< /highlight >}}


Lastly, you need to put the component to use in the app. Generally, this would be done after querying a list/collection of users. 

{{< file "html" "some.component.html" >}}
{{< highlight html >}}
<app-user-status [uid]="some-uid"></app-user-status>
{{< /highlight >}}

## The End

We now have a full realtime presence system that is effective in the majority of use-cases. It could be improved by implementing sophisticated logic for determining the *away* status and/or give users the ability to set their status manually. If you have any questions please drop us a line in Slack.
