Accepting crypto payments, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, in your app opens the door to more customers in a very fast growing niche. [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/?lang=en) is like the Stripe Payments API for crypto. It provides a simple API where you can create charges, invoices, etc. But unlike credit cards, which are processed by a central authority, crypto payments are distributed to a global network of miners where they are confirmed on the blockchain. The  confirmation process takes time and presents a variety of unique challenges for developers. 

The following tutorial demonstrates how to accept crypto payments with Coinbase Commerce, using Firebase Cloud Functions as your backend server. 

## Crypto Payment Flow

Crypto payments are push-based, which means Coinbase needs to constantly listen to the payment network for changes. The API sends webhooks whenever an important event happens with a charge. 

1. Your server creates a *charge* with an amount for the user to pay. Expires after 1 hour.  
2. The user pays, which puts the charge in *pending* status (handle via webhook). 
3. Some time later, up to 10 minutes, charge is *confirmed* or *failed* (handle via webhook).

## Initial Setup 

### Coinbase Commerce Account

ðŸ’¡ Although not required, it is a good idea to have a [personal Coinbase Account](https://fireship.page.link/coinbase) with ETH or BTC available for small test payments. Currently, Coinbase has no sandbox ðŸ™„, so you need to make real payments to test your integration.

Sign up for a [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/) account. 

Create an API key and make a note of the Webhook signing secret - they will be needed in the next section.

### Cloud Functions

Cloud functions are required to (1) create a payment intent *charge*, and to (2) listen to webhooks that are fired when the payment is sent and confirmed on the blockchain. Coinbase has a [Node SDK](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-commerce-node) to simplify the integration. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
firebase init functions

cd functions

npm install coinbase-commerce-node cors

# If using TypeScript use these types
npm install @types/coinbase-commerce-node --save-dev
```

Import the required packages:

{{< file "js" "functions/index.js" >}}
```javascript
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const cors = require('cors')({ origin: '*' });

const { Client, Webhook, resources } = require('coinbase-commerce-node');
const coinbaseSecret = 'your-api-key';
const signingSecret = 'your-webhook-secret';

Client.init(coinbaseSecret);

const { Charge } = resources;
```

## Backend

### Create a Charge

Create a [charge](https://commerce.coinbase.com/docs/api/#charges) with the amount and product details. This demo uses a static product in an HTTP cloud function, but you likely want to pass custom data via the request body. The resulting charge object provides a `hosted_url` field that can be shown to the end user where they can choose their preferred coin for payment. 

{{< file "js" "app.js" >}}
```javascript
exports.createCharge = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  cors(req, res, async () => {
    // TODO get real product data from database

    const chargeData = {
      name: 'Widget',
      description: 'Useless widget created by Fireship',
      local_price: {
        amount: 9.99,
        currency: 'USD',
      },
      pricing_type: 'fixed_price',
      metadata: {
        user: 'jeffd23',
      },
    };

    const charge = await Charge.create(chargeData);
    console.log(charge);

    res.send(charge);
  });
});
```

### Handle Webhooks

When the transaction's status changes on the blockchain, Coinbase will send a webhook (event) to your server. 

- `pending` means the user has submitted a payment, but it's not confirmed on the blockchain yet. 
- `confirmed` payment is completed. OK to ship. 
- `failed` payment failed. Do NOT ship. 

For security, it's essential to call `Webhook.verifyEventBody` with your webhook secret from Coinbase dashboard. Without this step, a hacker could pretend to be Coinbase and send webhooks to your server.  

Create another HTTP cloud function to handle webhooks. 

{{< file "js" "functions/index.js" >}}
```javascript
exports.webhookHandler = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const rawBody = req.rawBody;
  const signature = req.headers['x-cc-webhook-signature'];

  try {
    const event = Webhook.verifyEventBody(rawBody, signature, signingSecret);
    functions.logger.info(event);

    if (event.type === 'charge:pending') {
      // TODO
      // user paid, but transaction not confirm on blockchain yet
    }

    if (event.type === 'charge:confirmed') {
      // TODO
      // all good, charge confirmed
    }

    if (event.type === 'charge:failed') {
      // TODO
      // charge failed or expired
    }

    res.send(`success ${event.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    functions.logger.error(error);
    res.status(400).send('failure!');
  }
});

```

### Serve or Deploy the Functions

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
firebase serve

# Deployment required to handle webhooks
firebase deploy
```

## Frontend

### Fetch with Vanilla JS

The frontend code needs to make a request to the cloud function to create a charge. When the charge object is available, it can redirect or display a link to the hosted payment page. 

{{< file "html" "index.html" >}}
```html
<button id="btn">Buy Something with Crypto</button>

<p id="pay"></p>


<script>
    const btn = document.getElementById('btn');
    const pay = document.getElementById('pay');

    btn.onclick = async() => {
        const res = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/fireship-demos/us-central1/createCharge');
        const charge = await res.json();

        console.log(charge);

        pay.innerHTML = `<a href="${charge.hosted_url}">Pay Now!</a>`
    }
</script>
```
