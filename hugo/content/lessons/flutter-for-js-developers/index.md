So you're a web developer working with JavaScript and you want to get into Flutter? That was me about one-year ago and, at the time, learning an uncommon language like Dart seemed ridiculous. Then I tried it... To my surprise, it felt very comfortable right out of the gate. This is is partly due to my use of TypeScript over the last few years, so JS devs that hate type systems my experience different results. 

JavaScript and C# have had two babies

Throughout this lesson, you will see the 👉 emoji. Dart will always be on the left, and JS on the right. These are not always perfect 1-to-1 comparisons, but you get the idea.

## The Tradeoffs

Flutter is awesome 🤟 because ...

- has amazing docs
- performs faster because it has no JavaScript bridge
- can integrates native code
- hot reloads
- small code footprint and no import/export/bundling headaches
- poised for future development with [Fuchsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia)
- writing code in dart is like being on autopilot

Flutter is meh 😒 because...

- you have to learn dart
- cannot be debugged in the browser 
- has a small ecosystem of developers and plugins relative to JS

## Basics

### Variables

- `SomeType foo;` 👉 `let foo`
- `final` 👉 `const`
- `const` 👉 `Object.freeze(obj)`

```ts
// Reassignable varaibles
let name: string;
name = 'jeff';

// Single assignment variables
const lucky: number = 23;

const whoKnows: any = getSomethingDynamic();
```

```dart
String name;
name = 'jeff';


final int luckNumber = 23;

dynamic whoKnows = getSomethingDynamic();
var whoKnows = getSomethingDynamic();
```

### Functions
### 

## TypeScript Type Annotations


```ts
var foo = 'bar';
const lucky: number = 23;
```

```dart
final int lucky = 23;
```

## Classes


### Constructors

### Getters/Setters

### 

## Async Programming

### Future 👉 Promise

Dart provides 

The dart syntax is almost identical to JS, which is really nice because this is one of the more complex concepts for new devs to learn. 

### Stream 👉 Observable

JavaScript does not have a *native* stream-like data structure [yet](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable), but they are commonly provided via supporting packages like RxJS, Mobx, and others. A stream is similar.  

There is one big concept to keep in mind, single subscription streams (default) will throw an error if multiple subscribers try to listen. 

- Single-subscription streams 👉 Cold observable
- Broadcast streams 👉 Hot Observable


Even though streams are available in Dart, I often find myself using [RxDart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/rxdart) in Flutter. The beauty of RxDart is that it builds on top of streams, rather than try to reinvent the wheel, so anything that uses a stream in Flutter can also use an Rx observable. Also, if you're coming from the Angular world you can keep the operators you know and love like `switchMap`, `takeUntil`, `scan`, and so on. 

## Flutter vs JS Frameworks

Flutter is inspired by JavaScript frameworks like React/Angular/Vue that enable components to reactively update the UI when data changes. In fact, Flutter provides a `setState` method that works exactly like it does in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate).

Overall, it is not very opinionated about how architect the app. You can use composition to build a bunch of tiny widgets and piece them together, or create big widgets to be inherited. 

### Pubspec.yaml 👉 Package.json

Dependencies are registered in a. yaml

### Widget 👉 Component

### Themes and Styles 👉 CSS

In flutter you create themes and style widgets directly directly. This
