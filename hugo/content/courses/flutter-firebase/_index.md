**Flutter Firebase - The Full Course** will take you from zero to a complex production-ready iOS or Android app using real-world cloud infrastructure.

## ⚡ What will I build?

<span class="tag tag-sm tag-pro">Updated June 15th, 2022</span> <span class="tag tag-sm tag-flutter">Flutter v3.1</span>

This is a project-based course that will teach you how to build a multiple choice quiz app, inspired by apps like Duolingo and QuizUp. The app implements user authentication (Sign in with Google or Apple), tracks quiz progress in Firestore, uses dynamic animations, and shares data between screens. 

A quiz was chosen because it provides a <span class="hi">moderate amount of complexity with plenty of variety</span> between learning concepts. My mission is to teach non-trivial concepts without getting bogged down into repetitive or boring tasks.

- 🔏 User Authentication (Apple, Google, Anonymous)

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is intermediate level and designed to help you become a productive full-stack Flutter app developer. It assumes you have some basic knowledge of programming, ideally in a language similar to JavaScript, C#, or Java. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive.

If you're new to programming consider going through the [Dart Language Course](/courses/dart) first.

## 🚀 Test Drive

You can download the app we're building on Google Play or the App Store, so give it a test drive before you enroll.

## How do I enroll?

The first few videos are *free*, so just dive in 🤿. When you reach a paid module, you will be asked to pay for a single course or upgrade to PRO.
