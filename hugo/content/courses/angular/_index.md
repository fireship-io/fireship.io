The **Angular Firebase PWA Course** will teach you how to build a complex progressive web app with Angular 9 (ivy), Material Design, and Firebase. It starts from absolute basics and eventually culminates with the deployment of a server-rendered PWA on Google Cloud Run. 

You will build a full-stack [Kanban (看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) storyboard app inspired by Trello. Authenticated users can create, sort, update, and delete boards with all interaction persisted in Firestore.

- Firestore security rules
- Angular Universal with Nest.js
- Prerendering and/or deployment to Google Cloud Run 

### 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is intermediate level and designed to expose you to real-world challenges when building PWAs with Angular. It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of web programming and basic skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 


### 🏎️ Test Drive

Visit the [Firestarter demo app](https://firestarter.fireship.io/) and install it as a PWA to give it a test drive before you enroll.
