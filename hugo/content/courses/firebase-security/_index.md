**Firebase Security - The Full Course** will teach you how to write, organize, and test *Firestore security rules*. The goal is to prepare developers for the safe and secure launch of a Firebase project. 

## üõ°Ô∏è What will I Learn?

- Firestore security fundamentals.
- How to audit a Firebase app for security vulnerabilities. 
- Common use-cases including role-based auth, access-control lists, and more. 
- Advanced techniques and code optimization tips
- Unit testing and debugging reports

## ü§î Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is designed for experienced Firebase developers. It assumes you have built or are currently building a Firebase app, with the intention of shipping it without security vulnerabilities. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship/), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 

The course focuses on [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - if you're looking for specific Realtime Database techniques you may be disappointed.

## Is this Course Updated?

The last code review and update was completed on **December 3rd, 2020** using Firebase rules version `2.0`. The course receives regular updates, especially to address breaking changes Firebase.
