**Dart - The Full Course** is designed to teach you the fundamentals of the Dart language to prepare you for a successful journey into Flutter. 


## 🦄 What will I learn?

This course provides a tour of [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and teaches essential concepts for Flutter developers. Here's what you'll get out of it...

- 👨‍🎤 Become confident with the Dart language
- 🐦 Get Prepared for Flutter
- 🦺 Master null-safety
- 🦾 Learn how to use the Dart CLI
- 🕹️ Practice OOP and Functional Programming Concepts
- 🌊 Asynchronous programming with Futures & Streams


## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is beginner level 🟢 and will walk you through the fundamentals of Dart. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/fireship), but far more in-depth and followed in a long linear format.

### When was the course last updated?

<span class="tag tag-sm tag-pro">Updated October 13th, 2021</span> <span class="tag tag-sm tag-flutter">Dart 2.14</span>

### How do I enroll?

The first few videos are *free*, so just jump in. When you reach a paid module, you will be asked to pay for a single course or upgrade to PRO.
