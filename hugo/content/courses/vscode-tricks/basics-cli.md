When you [install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), it adds the `code` command to your terminal. 

⚠️ If you do not have access to the `code` command, follow the setup instructions for your machine [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

## ✨ Trick - Open VS Code from the Terminal

Use the CLI to launch a new VS Code window, or open a file in the current workspace.

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
code . # current working dir
code /path/to/dir # path
code ~/.bash_profile # edit a root config file
```
