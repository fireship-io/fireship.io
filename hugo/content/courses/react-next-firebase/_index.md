## 🦄 What will I build?

You will build a full-stack **Social Blogging Platform** inspired by sites like 🌈 [DEV.to](https://dev.to) and [Medium](https://medium.com).

- 👨‍🎤 Custom Firebase usernames
- 📰 Bot-friendly content (SEO)
- 🦾 Advanced SSR, SSG, and ISR techniques
- 🔥 Firestore realtime CRUD and data modeling
- ⚛️ Reactive forms with react-hook-form
- 📂 Image file uploads
- 💞 Realtime hearts
- 🚀 Security & Deployment



## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is intermediate level 🟦 and will challenge you to build an app that delivers high-performance and search engine visibility via server-side rendering. It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of web programming with familiarity of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and followed in a long linear format.

### Test drive

Visit the demo app and give it a test drive before you enroll.
