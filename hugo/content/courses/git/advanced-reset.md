Unstage all staged files. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
git reset
```

Rollback to a previous commit, BUT keep your changes in the working directory. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
git reset <commit-ID>
```

Rollback to a previous commit AND discard all changes. Be careful with this one. 

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
git reset <commit-ID> --hard
```
