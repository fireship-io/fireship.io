**Git & GitHub - The Full Course** teaches you how to use Git and GitHub to manage your code like a professional software engineer. We take a hands approach to learn the basics of version control from the command line, then level up with a bunch of VS Code tips and tricks.


## 🦄 What will I learn?

This course will teach the basics of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) - essential tools used by virtually every software engineer on the planet. Here's what you'll get out of it...

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is beginner level 🟢 and will walk you through the fundamentals of Git & GitHub. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and followed in a long linear format.
