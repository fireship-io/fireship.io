## Manifesto

### 1. 🤗 Developer Happiness and Productivity

> For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness - Ralph Waldo Emerson

Building software is not easy and never will be. Unhappiness grows exponentially with the complexity of your project, so think about optimizing happiness around every turn. There is no universal truth here, but use tools that make you more productive, leverage APIs that solve your problems quickly, and write as little code as possible. 

### 2. 🤝🏼 No Single Paradigm

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing - Socrates

Do not be limited by any single paradigm or narrow set of ideas. The best-practices of today will be called anti-patterns tomorrow. End-users do not care *how* you built the product, but rather *what* it does to make their lives better. 

### 3. 🍞 Embrace Simplicity, Ignore Hype

> I have great expectations for the future, because the past was highly overrated - Sylvester Stallone

There is a complex ecosystem of competing interests in the OSS industry, many of which are built on hype. It is never easy to navigate, but always ask yourself *is this the best tool for the job*?. Just because *Tool X* has a fancy interface and is used by *Hipster App Inc* does not mean you should use it. We have a tendency to over-engineer everything - fight this urge.
 

### 4. 🧰 *Code* is Just a Tool

> However tight things are, you still need to have the big picture at the forefront of your mind. - Richard Branson

Software is about solving problems for people. *Code* is just one piece of the bigger puzzle that is *building a product*. Do not get trapped into over-thinking the technical aspects of a project. Take a walk outside and think about the mission, the end user, the marketing, and the community. The more you focus on the smallest details, the more likely you are to lose sight of the big picture. 

### 5. 🚀 Ship It

> It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. - Confucius

It is difficult to finish a product, but *done is better than perfect*. You can expect many setbacks during the development of an app, and progress is made by consistently improving your work in small steps. When you ship your MVP - even if it sucks - you will start to get valuable feedback that will drive all future decisions. I cannot overstate the importance of this - listen to your customers.
