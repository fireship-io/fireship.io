Jarrett is a code enthusiast from the Central Michigan area. He is a jack-of-all-trades engineer with experiences in just about everything you can shake a stick at. When not slangin' code for federal health care contracts, he finds enjoyment with side projects through different LLCs and is always open for more consultations. On the occasion he is not coding or sleeping, you can find him chilling with his wife and daughter.
