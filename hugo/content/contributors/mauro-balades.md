My name is Mauro Baladés. I am a student who lives in Spain. I love computers 🤓 and I am always focusing on improving my programming skills.

I have been learning programming since 12 and in the meanwhile I was a music passonist. As for programming, I know a variaety of diferent programming languages suck as: Rust 🦀, Python 🐍 and more.
