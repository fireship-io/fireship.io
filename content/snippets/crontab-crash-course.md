[Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) is a long-running process used on Linux servers that ticks at specific times based on the crontab pattern (with a minimum of 1 minute of granularity). It is used to setup *cronjobs*, which are background tasks that get executed at a specific time or interval. Also, Firebase now has a [time-triggered](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/04/schedule-cloud-functions-firebase-cron.html) Cloud Function that can be set with crontab. The following guide will teach you how to schedule cronjobs in this format. 

Tip: I highly recommend checking out the [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/every-weekday) app, as opposed to memorizing all the examples below. 

## Crontab Overview

A cron schedule is defined by setting values in five slots `* * * * *`. Each slot can take a single number, range of numbers, or `*` wildcard. Each slot is defined as:

1. **Minute** (0-59) Minute of the hour
2. **Hour**	(0-23) Hour of the day
3. **Day**	(1-31)	Day of the month
4. **Month** (1-12)	Month of the year
5. **Weekday** (0-6) Day of the week where, Sunday == 0, Monday == 1, ..., Saturday == 6. 
6. The script to execute (not necessary for Cloud Functions)

## Example Schedules

The snippets below show you how to configure crontab for the most common use-cases. 

### Every Minute

Remember, a cronjob can only be scheduled to a minimum interval of 1 minute. If we leave every value as a wildcard it will execute after every minute. 

```text
* * * * *
```

### Every 15 Minutes

You can use a slash for step values, meaning it will execute every N steps. 

```text
*/15 * * * *
```


### Every Day at 5:30 AM

We can schedule a daily task by defining the minute and hour values. 

```text
30 5 * * *
```

To make this 5:30 PM just add 12 to the hours. 

```text
30 17 * * *
```

### Twice per Day at 10AM & 10PM

We can separate values by commas to have them execute at multiple values

```text
0 10,22 * * *
```

### Every Monday & Wednesday at 8PM

We can run jobs on specific days of the week using the last slot. 

```text
0 20 * * 1,3
```


### Every 5 Minutes, between 9AM and 5PM, from Monday through Friday

Maybe we have a task that should only run during normal business hours. 

This can be accomplished using ranges for the hour and weekday values that are separated by a dash. 

In other words: "At every 5th minute past every hour from 9 through 17 on every day-of-week from Monday through Friday"

```text
*/5 9-17 * * 1-5
```
