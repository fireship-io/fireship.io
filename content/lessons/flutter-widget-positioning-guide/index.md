The addition of Flexbox to CSS revolutionized the way we position elements on the web. It makes the alignment of elements on a 2D plane automatic and well, flexible. Fortunately, Flutter uses the same principles for aligning widgets with [Flex](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Flex-class.html), Column, and Row. In addition, it supports absolute and fixed positioning with [Stack](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html). 

The following lesson will teach you how to position containers and build layouts in Flutter with direct comparisons to CSS [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox). 


Throughout this lesson, you will see the ðŸ‘‰ emoji. Flutter will always be on the left, and CSS on the right.

## Basic Positioning for Single Widgets

Do you need to position **one widget or multiple widgets?** If you answered one, you likely want to wrap your widget with a [Container](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html). 

### Container

Containers serve as an all-purpose wrapper for positioning and styling widgets. They are similar to an HTML `div` in the sense that they serve as blank UI elements that can be positioned/styled. Below is a list of the most common positioning options. 

{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Container( 
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    margin: EdgeInsets.all(24),
    padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 24),
    alignment: Alignment.center,
    transform: Transform.rotate(...),
    child: MyCoolWidget()
)
```

{{< figure src="img/basic.png" alt="basic margin and padding on flutter widget" >}}


The equivalent HTML/CSS would look something like this:

{{< file "css" "style.css" >}}
```js
.my-cool-widget {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 24px;
    padding-top: 24px;
    text-align: center; 
}
/*  <div class="my-cool-widget"></div>  */
```




### Padding, Center, Align, and More

In many cases, you will not need the full kitchen-sink of features in a container. For example, when you only need to provide padding to a widget, consider using the [Padding](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html) widget, or if you just want to center a widget wrap it in [Center](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html). It will make your code more readable and succinct. 

{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Padding( 
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(24),
    child: MyCoolWidget()
)

Center( 
    child: MyCoolWidget()
)
```


## CSS Flexbox vs Flutter Rows and Columns


### A Basic Row & Column

Rows and Columns are identical in every way, just with their axis flipped. 

{{< figure src="img/row.png" alt="row of three boxes in Flutter" >}}

{{< figure src="img/col.png" alt="column of three boxes in Flutter" >}}

{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Column(
    children: [
        MyWidget(),
        MyWidget(),
        MyWidget()
    ]
);

// or swap a Column for a Row to flip the axis

Row(children: [ ]);

// and this is all just sugar for the Flex widget
Flex(
    direction: Axis.vertical
)
```



### MainAxis vs CrossAxis

- `mainAxisAlignment` ðŸ‘‰ `align-items`;
- `crossAxisAlignment` ðŸ‘‰ `justify-content`;


In Flutter, you might find yourself asking should I set the `mainAxisAlignment` or `crossAxisAlignment`. The answer depends whether you're aligning a Row or Column. 

The **MainAxis** runs along the flow or direction of the widgets, so X-axis for Rows and Y-axis for Columns. The **CrossAxis** is the opposite. 

On the main-axis, you control the spacing between the widgets. On the cross-axis, you control the alignment within the parent container. 


{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Column(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
    crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
    children: [
        MyWidget(),
        MyWidget(height: 200.0, width: 200.0),
        MyWidget(height: 50.0, width: 50.0)
    ]
);
```


{{< figure src="img/cross-aligned.png" alt="aligned boxes Flutter" >}}

In CSS we can achieve the same effect with a flex row or column.

{{< file "css" "style.css" >}}
```js
.row {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: flex-start;
}
```

### Expanded

Sometimes you need to specify flex behavior from a child widget. The [Expanded](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html) widget will take up the remaining space of a row or column. It takes an optional `flex` argument to control the ratio of space used when working with multiple expanded widgets. 

Notice how the middle widget has a flex of `3`, while the last widget has a flex of `1`. This means the middle widget will take up 3x more space. In other words, it will expand to 75% of the available space, while the last widget will take up the remaining 25%. 

{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Column(
    children: [
        MyWidget(),
        Expanded(
            flex: 3,
            child: MyWidget(),
        ),
        Expanded(
            flex: 1,
            child: MyWidget()
        )
    ]
);
}
```

{{< figure src="img/expanded.png" alt="expanded flex widget in Flutter" >}}

The CSS equivalent:


{{< file "css" "style.css" >}}
```js
.column {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.expanded1 {
    flex-grow: 1;
}

.expanded3 {
    flex-grow: 3;
}
```


## Stacks vs Absolute/Fixed Positioning

A Stack allows you to stack elements on top of each other, with the last element in the array taking the highest priority. You can use `Align`, `Positioned` or `Container` to position the children of a stack. 

### Align

Widgets are moved by setting the alignment with `Alignment`, which has static properties like *topCenter*, *bottomRight*, and so on. Or you can take full control and set `Alignment(1.0, -1.0)`, which takes x,y values ranging from 1.0 to -1.0, with (0,0) being the center of the screen. 

{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Stack(
    children: [
        MyWidget(),
        Align(
            alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
            child: MyWidget(),
        ),
        Container(
            alignment: Alignment(-0.9, -0.9),
            child: MyWidget(),
        )  
    ]
);
```

{{< figure src="img/aligned.png" alt="aligned boxes Flutter" >}}

### Positioned

As an alternative to align, you can position children relative to the parent widget. 


{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
Stack(
    children: [
        MyWidget(),
        Positioned(
            bottom: 20,
            left: 20,
            child: MyWidget(color: Colors.blue),
        ),
        Positioned(
            top: 50,
            right: 50,
            child: MyWidget(color: Colors.red)
        )
    ]
)
```

{{< figure src="img/positioned.png" alt="positioned boxes Flutter" >}}

And with CSS absolute positioning. 

{{< file "css" "style.css" >}}
```js
.positioned {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 20,
    left: 20,
}
```

## The End

As you can see, CSS shares many of the same positioning and alignment concepts with Flutter. In 99% of cases, you can solve your positioning requirements with Container, Column, Row, and Stack. The beauty of Flutter is that you have the power to paint every pixel on the device when needed in more advanced scenarios.
