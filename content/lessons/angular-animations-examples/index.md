<p>Animation is often the X-factor that sets remarkable apps apart from average apps. In this lesson, I provide five basic animation examples based on Angular 4.3+. This article covers the animation techniques I find most useful when building Angular apps, but check out this excellent post on <a href="https://www.yearofmoo.com/2017/06/new-wave-of-animation-features.html">new Angular 4.2 animation features</a> for a more comprehensive look at the latest features.</p>

All animations can be boiled down into two simple steps:

- Define on how an element should look in a certain state
- Define how it should transition between states

Angular uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">Web Animations API</a> (WAAPI), which shares many similarities to CSS3 animations. WAAPI is fully production ready today because it ships with an advanced polyfill library to support most browsers.  


## Initial Setup

<p>Angular Animations are kept in their own module, so we need to import them into the module where they will be used.</p>

```typescript

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserAnimationsModule
  ],
})
```

## 1. Basic Animation Two-State

<img src="https://angularfirebase.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/animate-1.gif" alt="animated pop over in Angular 4" width="600" height="338" class="content-image" />

{{< figure src="img/animate-1.gif" caption="animated popover" >}}


<p>In this example, we create a simple popover component that the user can toggle with a button click. When active, it animates the opacity to 1, when inactive it’s opacity is 0. </p>

You build Angular animations by giving them a name, then use them in the HTML by passing an expressions, such as 'show' or 'hide'.

```html
<span [@animationName]="stateOfElement">Content</span>
```

In the component TypeScript, you define the appearance of 'show' and 'hide', then define the timing for a transition between the states.


```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

import {
  trigger,
  state,
  style,
  animate,
  transition
} from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
  selector: 'pop-over',
  templateUrl: './pop-over.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./pop-over.component.scss'],
  animations: [
    trigger('popOverState', [
      state('show', style({
        opacity: 1
      })),
      state('hide',   style({
        opacity: 0
      })),
      transition('show => hide', animate('600ms ease-out')),
      transition('hide => show', animate('1000ms ease-in'))
    ])
  ]
})
export class PopOverComponent {

  show = false;

  constructor() { }

  get stateName() {
    return this.show ? 'show' : 'hide'
  }


  toggle() {
    this.show = !this.show;
  }

}
```

In the HTML, we can now apply this animation to a div and provide a button to toggle the state between show and hide.

```html
<div [@popOverState]="stateName">
        <p>Hello! I'm a helpful message.</p>
</div>
<button (click)="toggle()">Toggle PopOver</button>
```

## 2. MultiState Animation

{{< figure src="img/animate-2.gif" caption="multi state animation" >}}


<p>Now let’s build an animation that can move between multiple states. This will translate (move), rotate (spin), and scale (enlarge) the image around the screen. Notice how I am using the wildcard transition `* => *` to apply the same transition settings to all states.</p>

<p>Note: The transitions on top will have higher priority, so always put the wildcard transitions on the bottom. </p>

```typescript
  animations: [
    trigger('photoState', [
      state('move', style({
        transform: 'translateX(-100%)',
      })),
      state('enlarge',   style({
        transform: 'scale(1.5)',
      })),
      state('spin',   style({
        transform: 'rotateY(180deg) rotateZ(90deg)',
      })),
      transition('* => *', animate('500ms ease')),
    ])
  ]
```

## 3. Keyframe Animation

{{< figure src="img/animate-3.gif" caption="keyframe animation" >}}


<p>What if you want to control the intermediate steps in an animation? That’s where <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes">keyframes</a> come in. </p>

<p>Every keyframe has an offset ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, which represents its position in time relative to the animation duration. If an animation runs for 1000ms, a keyframe offset of 0.25 is equivalent to 250ms. </p>

<p>Let’s build on the last example with keyframes.   </p>

```typescript
  transition('* => move',
    animate('2000ms', keyframes([
      style({transform: 'translateX(0)    rotateY(0)',        offset: 0}),
      style({transform: 'translateX(50%)  rotateY(90deg)',    offset: 0.33}),
      style({transform: 'translateY(-75%) rotateY(180deg)',   offset: 0.66}),
      style({transform: 'translateX(-100%)',                  offset: 1.0})
    ])
  ))
```

## 4. Animation Callbacks

{{< figure src="img/animate-4.gif" >}}

<p>Sometimes you might want to trigger code when an animation is completed. In this example, we create an event handler to console log the animation start and done events.</p>

```typescript
  logAnimation($event) {
    console.log(`${this.position} animation ${$event.phaseName}`)
  }
```

In the template, we can fire the event handler when the animation sends of the start and done events.

```html
  <img [src]="photoUrl"
      [@photoState]="position"
      (@photoState.start)="logAnimation($event)"
      (@photoState.done)="logAnimation($event)">
```

<p class="success">Callbacks are great for orchestrating a complex sequence of animations throughout your app.</p>

## 5. Animating Lists

{{< figure src="img/animate-5.gif" caption="animated list with query and stagger in angular" >}}

<p>A common UX feature is to sequentially animate a list of items. It would be cumbersome to define a bunch of delayed animations, which is the problem solved by `query` and `stagger`. Query allows you select HTML elements within an animation, while stagger will build the delay interval based on the size of a collection. In this example, we query all `img` tags and translate them off the page, then animate them within `stagger` to automatically create the shutter-like effect. </p>

```typescript
animations: [
    trigger('photosAnimation', [
      transition('* => *', [
        query('img',style({ transform: 'translateX(-100%)'})),
        query('img',
          stagger('600ms', [
            animate('900ms', style({ transform: 'translateX(0)'}))
        ]))
      ])
    ])
  ]
```

In the HTML, we pass the length of the array to the animation, then loop over the images using `*ngFor`.

```html
<div [@photosAnimation]="photos.length">
  <div *ngFor="let photo of photos">
      <img  [src]="photo" >
  </div>
</div>
```
