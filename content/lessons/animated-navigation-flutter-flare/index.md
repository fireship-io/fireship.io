Whenever I see an awesome UI element in a native app my first question is *How do I make that in Flutter?*. That's exactly what I asked when I downloaded the [Giphy](https://giphy.com/apps) Android app recently, which has runs a colorful and fun animation for each icon in the bottom navbar.

These animations are complex. Hypothetically, they could be created in Flutter natively with a custom painter, but that would be very challenging and painful. Thankfully, we have [Flare 2D](https://www.2dimensions.com/about-flare) a design tool that makes it easy to create complex animations with vector graphics and run them in Flutter's rendering engine at 60+ FPS. 

## Part 1: Create Animated Icons with Flare 2D


Access the files used in this lesson on my [Flare profile](https://www.2dimensions.com/a/delaneyphx/files/recent/all) or from the project github repo. 


First, we need to create some awesome animated graphics with Flare. Create a free account, then complete the tasks below. These tasks represent the skills you need to have in Flare to re-create Giphy's animated icons. 

I highly recommend memorizing the following hotkeys. 

- `T` translate or move shapes around.
- `S` scale or resize shapes.
- `R` rotate shapes.
- Hold `space` to drag around the screen. 
- `ctrl+Z` to undo. 


### Draw a Shape

Flare provides a basic set of design tools that we can use to draw vector graphics. You can also design your graphics in a different tool, like Figma or Sketch for example, then import them into Flare. 


**Tasks**

1. Draw a basic star shape using the star tool. 
1. Center it on the artboard and have it take up as much space on the Y axis as possible. 
1. Remove the stroke and adjust the fill color.

### Animate the Fill Color

We can animate almost anything on the shape. Let's get familiar with the animation timeline by animating the color of the star from gray to yellow. 

**Tasks**

1. Switch to animation mode. 
1. Change the untitled animation name to *go* (this will be important when we get the Flutter code). 
1. Create a keyframe by selecting the diamond next to the fill control. 
1. Scrub the timeline to the end and change the fill color. A new keyfame would be added automatically. 
1. Press play. You just created an animation. 

{{< figure src="img/flare-star-animated.png" caption="Animate the fill color of the star" >}}

### Animate Transformations - Translate, Scale, Rotate

An easy way to bring your shapes to life is by animating size, movement, and rotation angle. 

**Tasks**

1. Create keyframes for rotation and scale. 
2. Adjust the key interpolation to make to ease the timing. 

{{< figure src="img/flare-star-rotate.png" caption="Animate the rotation of the star and change the key interpolation to cubic" >}}


### Animate the Shape

We can also animate the verticies of the star to to transform it into a completely different shape. 


**Tasks**

1. Add a keyframe to edit verticies. 
1. Click "edit verticies", scrub to a different time,  move the verticies to automatically add a keyframe. 

{{< figure src="img/flare-star-vert.png" caption="Use the verticies to change and animate the points of the shape" >}}

### Animate the Stroke for a Hand-Drawn Effect

Stroke animations make it easy to look like you are drawing a shape by hand. 

**Tasks**

1. Give the shape a stroke.
1. Set the end of  the stroke to 0% until it is invisible. 
1. Animate the end value to give it a drawing effect. 

{{< figure src="img/flare-animated-stroke.png" caption="Animate the stroke end from 0% to 100%" >}}

### Animate the Position in a Clipping Mask

Clipping masks allow you to make shapes disappear behind another shape. A clipping mask is like installing a window on the house - you can only see the contents inside its boundaries. 


**Tasks**

1. Create a new shape that covers the star. 
1. Select the star, then click *clipping box*, then select the new shape. 
1. Go into animation mode and animate the position of the star. 

{{< figure src="img/flare-star-clip.png" caption="Create another shape to serve as a clipping box for the star. " >}}


## Part 2 - Flutter Flare Integration

Flare provides package that makes it dead simple to use our animations into an iOS or Android app with Flutter. Run to `flutter create your_project` to get started. The end goal is to build a usable animated icon navigation menu like the demo below: 

{{< vimeo 328094871 >}}

### Add flare_flutter to pubspec.yaml

Add [flare_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flare_flutter) to the `pubspec.yaml`.

{{< file "yaml" "build.yaml" >}}
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  flare_flutter: any


flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
   - assets/  

```


### Export your Animations to Flutter

Export the animations to a folder named `assets` in the root of your project. 

{{< figure src="img/flare-export-screen.png" caption="Export the binary file from Flare" >}}


### Define a Class for the Menu Item

There are many different ways to build a menu in flutter, but we're going to build our navigation menu from scratch. The data for each menu item can be abstracted into a class. 

- `name` is the filename of the *.flr* asset
- `color` controls the line above the icon
- `x` is the X-axis alignment of the item (-1 is far left, 1 is far right). 

{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
class MenuItem {
  final String name;
  final Color color;
  final double x;
  MenuItem({this.name, this.color, this.x});
}

```

### Animating the Colored Top Bar

Our navigation menu is wrapped in a StatefulWidget to keep track of the currently selected item. Here's a breakdown of each important line of code. 

1. Set a default menu item on `initState`. 
2. Define a [Stack](https://fireship.io/lessons/flutter-widget-positioning-guide/). The first element is an container for the colored , while the second item is the navigation menu row.. 
3. Create an [AnimatedContainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI-8QHpGIP4&vl=en) that takes up 20% of the screen width and is aligned to the active menu item. 
4. Define a *Row* to hold the Flare graphics that uses `spaceAround` alignment on the main axis. 


{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
class NavBar extends StatefulWidget {
  createState() => NavBarState();
}

class NavBarState extends State<NavBar> {
  List items = [
    MenuItem(x: -1.0, name: 'house', color: Colors.lightBlue[100]),
    MenuItem(x: -0.5, name: 'planet', color: Colors.purple),
    MenuItem(x: 0.0, name: 'camera', color: Colors.greenAccent),
    MenuItem(x: 0.5, name: 'heart', color: Colors.pink),
    MenuItem(x: 1.0, name: 'head', color: Colors.yellow),
  ];

  MenuItem active;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    active = items[0]; // <-- 1. Activate a menu item
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    double w = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
    return Container(
      height: 80,
      color: Colors.black,
      child: Stack(    //  <-- 2. Define a stack
        children: [
          AnimatedContainer(  //  <-- 3. Animated top bar
            duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
            alignment: Alignment(active.x, -1),
            child: AnimatedContainer(
              duration: Duration(milliseconds: 1000),
              height: 8,
              width: w * 0.2,
              color: active.color,
            ),
          ),
          Container(  // <-- 4. Main menu row
            child: Row(   
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end,
              children: items.map((item) {
                return _flare(item);  // <-- 5. Flare graphic will go here
            ),
          )
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

}
```


### Animating the Flare Graphics

In this final section, we define a method that will turn the Flare animations into tap-able buttons that change the state of the widget. This can be achieved with a `setState` call from a *GestureDetector*, as we do not want Material ink splashes in this demo. 

The *FlareActor* is a widget from the flare_flutter package that will run the specified animation when the state changes. 


Remember, we defined the animation name as *go* in the Flare editor before exporting the file. By default, the animation name is *Untitled*. 


{{< file "dart" "main.dart" >}}
```dart
  Widget _flare(MenuItem item) {
    return GestureDetector(
      child: AspectRatio(
        aspectRatio: 1,
        child: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 20),
          child: FlareActor(
            'assets/${item.name}.flr',
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            fit: BoxFit.contain,
            animation: item.name == active.name ? 'go' : 'idle',
          ),
        ),
      ),
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          active = item;
        });
      },
    );
  }
```
