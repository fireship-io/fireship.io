The **Ionic4 Master Course** will teach you the fundamentals of full-stack cross-platform app development, using the combined powers of Angular & Firebase. 

### üóø What will I build?

This is a project-based course that starts from zero and works up to an **authenticated realtime todo list with push notifications**. While that may not sound super exciting, it provides an ideal foundation to showcase the UI features offered by Ionic and connect them to live cloud infrastructure. 


### üêå What will I Learn?

- Installation and Setup
- Ionic4 Component APIs
- Routing and Navigation
- Reactive Forms
- CSS Themes
- Platform Checking
- Push Notifications
- Cloud Function integration with NodeJS
- Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Messaging
- How to release Ionic to the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store
- And more...


### ü§î Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is an intermediate level project-based course where you *learn by doing*. It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of programming, ideally with web tech like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 


### üèéÔ∏è Test Drive

A live version of the app is currently available as a [Progressive Web App](https://ionic4-fire.web.app/).
