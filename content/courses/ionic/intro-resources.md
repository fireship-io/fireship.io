## How to Follow this Course

You should clone the project [source code](https://github.com/codediodeio/ionic4-master-course) as a reference. However, I recommend that you **create your own project from scratch**, then pause after each video and write some code. You will get the most out of a project-based course like this when you *learn by doing*. Experiment with your own code throughout the process and break things.
