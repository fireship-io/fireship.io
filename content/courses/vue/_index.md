## 🎤 What will I build?

The **Vue Firebase Project Course** will teach you the basics of full-stack web development by building a chat prototype from scratch.

You will build a realtime 💬 **walkie-talkie style chat app** with the ability to record and upload audio from the device - inspired by the popular [Voxer](https://www.voxer.com/) mobile app. 

## 💡 What will I Learn?

In this course you will learn...

- Fundamentals of of Vue components and reactivity
- Dynamic Vue routing
- User authentication with Firebase (Anonymous, Email/Password)
- Usage of the Vuefire Package
- Vue Composition API
- Chat Features in Firestore
- Record audio on the web
- Upload files to Firebase Storage


### 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is **intermediate level** and designed to expose you to useful patterns when building realtime web apps with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of web programming, including basic skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive.
