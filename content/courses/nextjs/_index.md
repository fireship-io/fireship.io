**Next.js - The Full Course** provides a in-depth look into the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) introduced in version 13.2. It puts React Server Components into practice by building a full-stack application from scratch with PostgreSQL and Prisma. 

## What will I learn?

- 👨‍🎤 Everything you need to be productive with modern Next.js 
- ⚡ Complex topics explained in 100 seconds
- 📚 Design patterns with React Server Components (RSC)
- 💎 How to choose optimal rendering strategies
- 🚅 Dynamic routing and project organization
- 🔥 Advanced data fetching and caching
- 👲 User authentication with Auth.js
- 📅 Data modeling with Postgres and Prisma
- 🤔 How to migrate from previous versions of Next.js

## 🦄 What will I build?

You will build a simple **Social Media Platform** inspired by sites like [MySpace](https://spacehey.com/) and Facebook where users can befriend each other. The goal of this project is to introduce you to Next's rendering, data-fetching, and caching strategies. 


## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

<div class="box box-blue">
This course is intermediate level 🟦 and expects some familiarity with React.js, JavaScript, and web development. The content is fast-paced and similar to my style on YouTube, but far more in-depth and should be followed in a linear format.

## When was the course last updated?

<span class="tag tag-sm tag-pro">Updated June 22nd, 2023</span> <span class="tag tag-sm tag-next">next v13.4</span>

## How do I enroll?

The first few videos are *free*, so just give it try. When you reach a paid module, you will be asked to pay for a single course or upgrade to PRO.
