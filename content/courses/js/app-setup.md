## Initial Setup

In this lesson, we will create a vanilla JavaScript app with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Vite is a fast and lightweight development server that uses native ES modules to serve your code. 

The app will also use OpenAI's Image Generation API to create a unique image with its Dalle-2 model.

```bash
npm init vite@latest dream

cd dream
npm install
npm run dev
```
