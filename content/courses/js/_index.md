**The JavaScript Course** teaches you how to build modern applications with vanilla JavaScript - no React, no TypeScript, no Frameworks - just plain old JavaScript. 


## 🦄 What will I learn?

This course is focused on the basics of [JavaScript](https://git-scm.com/) - the world's most [commonly used](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/) programming language. Here's what you'll get out of it...
