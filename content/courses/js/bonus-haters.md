# JavaScript for the Haters

JavaScript for the Haters dropped on Thanksgiving, November 24th, 2022.

JavaScript is a language that is used to build things it's not supposed to, and was created by Brendan Ike in 1995. It became an overnight dumpster fire in 2005 when Ryan Dahl made the Epic mistake of bringing it to the server with node.js. Today, JavaScript is used to build memory hogging desktop apps, with electron janky mobile apps, with react native, and unreliable APIs. Despite its problems, JavaScript has evolved into an awesome language in 2022.
