- ⚡ Breakdown of key concepts in 100 Seconds
- 📚 Design patterns and best practices
- 🎣 Component composition and custom hooks
- 🚀 Lazy loading with Suspense
- 📱 How to build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- 🎨 Animation with Framer Motion

- 🍰 More!


<!-- ## 🦄 What will I build?

You will build 5 different react apps from scratch.

1. **SuperCounter** A super counter to get the hang of the basics. 
1. **Memoratic** An installable Progressive Web App (PWA) game. 
1. **ForeverNote** Perform CRUD operations to store notes in a database with Firebase and React Router.
1. **UnWeather** A weather app that implements SSR with Next.js and React Query. 
1. **GeoForm** A multi-step geocoded form with animation via Framer Motion and  realtime data with Firebase.
1. **Whack-A-Foo** A game where you click as many boxes as you can in a given time period. -->




## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course starts at the beginner level 🟢 and progresses to intermediate in the hands-on projects. It assumes you have some basic knowledge of web programming with familiarity of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and followed in a long linear format.


## When was the course last updated?

<span class="tag tag-sm tag-pro">Updated Feb 22nd, 2022</span> <span class="tag tag-sm tag-next">React v18.0</span>

## How do I enroll?

While in preview, this course is only available to PRO Members. 

## 🚨 Work in Progress!

This course is a **Work in Progress**. It will be updated with new content weekly until it is completed in Spring 2023.
