Determine the best rendering strategy for your use-case. You may not need SSR at all if the app does not care about Search Engine Bots or Social Media link bots. 

## Strategies

### Server-side Rendering (SSR)

- Renders the app on every request
- Requires a Node.JS server 

### Prerendering

- Renders the app at build-time
- Can be deployed to Firebase Hosting
- Routes must be known in advance
