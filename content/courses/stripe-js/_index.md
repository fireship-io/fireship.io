The **Stripe Payments JavaScript Course** is a project-based guide to building fullstack payment solutions on the web with Node.js and React. 

The goal is to provide a solid foundation for *app monetization* 💸 by implementing common use-cases with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) APIs including Checkout, Payment Intents, and Billing.

## ⚡ What will I build?

You will build a fullstack web app with Node.js and React that contains the following features:

- Node.js Server with Express & TypeScript
- React frontend UI (functional components, hooks, & suspense)
- [3D Secure](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2) payment handling
- Manage Stripe customers and save cards
- Setup subscriptions, invoices, and recurring payments
- Securely listen to events from Stripe via webhooks
- Dockerize and deploy to Google Cloud Run

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is beginner-friendly, but expects you to have some experience with web development and JavaScript. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/fireship), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. I stand by my work 100%, so just drop me a line if you are not satisfied for any reason. 

## Is this Course Updated?

The last code review and update was completed on **October 15th, 2021** using Stripe API version `2020-03-02`. The course receives regular updates to address major changes to the Stripe API and its Node SDKs. 


## 🏎️ Test Drive

Try out the [Live Demo](https://stripe-js-course.firebaseapp.com). It uses Stripe test mode, so feel free to submit mock payments to the server.
