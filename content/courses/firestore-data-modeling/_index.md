The **Firestore Data Modeling Course** provides a foundation for modeling data relationships in NoSQL, while optimizing queries for performance, cost, and complexity. Determining the optimal data model in [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) is not an easy task because you need to anticipate your app's UI/UX requirements in advance. Failure to consider the tradeoffs between various data models could lead to poor app performance and/or unnecessary cloud computing expenses. The goal of this course is to teach you the concepts necessary to *make good decisions* related to data modeling that minimize costs and maximize read performance. 

## Topics Covered

- Core Concepts in Firestore.
- Comparisons to SQL data modeling. 
- Advanced methods for reading and querying data. 
- Relational data modeling concepts like one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. 
- How to avoid common pitfalls and anti-patterns.
- Examples of data models for common real-world app features.
