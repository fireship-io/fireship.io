**SvelteKit - The Full Course** is a hands-on tutorial where you will build a complete web app with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and Firebase - the so-called FKIT stack. 

## What will I learn?

- 👨‍🎤 Everything you need to be productive with SvelteKit
- ⚡ Essential Svelte topics explained in 100 seconds
- 💪 Server-side rendering, SEO, data fetching, and caching
- 🍪 Cookie-based user authentication
- 💥 Build complex forms with SvelteKit Actions
- 🦋 Integrate Tailwind and DaisyUI with SvelteKit
- 🤏 Fullstack Drag-and-drop from scratch
- 🔥 How to rapidly ship complex features with Firebase
- 🤔 Analysis of potential design choices and their tradeoffs
- 🎨 Svelte animations with real-world data
- 💎 Deploy SvelteKit with serverless functions

## 🦄 What will I build?

You will build a **Social Link Sharing Platform** inspired by [🌴 Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) where users can publish and edit a profile for their social media links. The goal of this project is to leverage SvelteKits's rendering capabilities with a variety of user authentication and data fetching patterns. By the end of the course, you will be a certified FKIT stack expert. 

### 🚀 Try it out!

Visit the demo app and give it a test drive before you enroll. It includes cookie-based auth, an animated multistep sign-in form, drag-and-drop data mutations, and more:

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

<div class="box box-blue">
This course is intermediate level 🟦 and expects some familiarity with JavaScript and web development. The content is fast-paced and similar to my style on YouTube, but far more in-depth and should be followed in a linear format.

## How do I enroll?

The first few videos are *free*, so just give it try. When you reach a paid module, you will be asked to pay for a single course or upgrade to PRO.
