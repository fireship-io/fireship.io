  While working with Zack on preparing the course, he pointed out some stuff in Supabase that I didn’t even know about!
  This course should be <span class="hi">required viewing</span> for anyone building web apps with Supabase; it makes the flow of development to prod then continuing to ship crystal clear!

  This course is a must for anyone building with Supabase. One of the most comprehensive (and entertaining) tutorials on the web. As a bonus, you’ll <span class="hi">learn a tonne</span> of things about Postgres and SQL that are useful beyond Supabase.
  If you’re shipping a production-ready website or application, this course is 100% recommended

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

<div class="box box-blue">
This course is intermediate level 🟦 and expects some experience with React, JavaScript, and general web development. It is fast-paced and similar to my style on YouTube, but far more in-depth and with hands on projects and quizzes.
