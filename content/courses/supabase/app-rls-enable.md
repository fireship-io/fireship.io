Turning on RLS via SQL:

```sql
alter table <table name> enable row level security
```

RLS Policies for the user_profile table:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "all can see" ON "public"."user_profiles"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "users can insert" ON "public"."user_profiles"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "owners can update" ON "public"."user_profiles"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR UPDATE
TO public
USING (auth.uid()=user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid()=user_id);
```
