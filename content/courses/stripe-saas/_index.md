**Stripe for SaaS Full Course** is a hands-on tutorial where you will build a monetized web app with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). 

## ⚡ What will I learn?

- 💵 Everything you need to build complex payment flows with Stripe
- 💷 One-time payments
- 💶 Recurring subscriptions
- ⏱️ Metered pay-as-you-go billing
- 🎣 Handle and test Stripe webhooks locally 
- 🤝 Payment and billing strategies for SaaS products 
- 🔥 Master key concepts quickly with fast-paced vidoes
- ⚛️ Fullstack starter project with Next.js frontend and Supabase backend
- 🧑‍💻 Includes all source code and project files

## 🦄 What will I build?

You will build a **Stock Photography Subscription SaaS Product** from scratch where users can sign up for a subscription to access a library of images. Every monetized action is tracked in Stripe and the user is billed based on usage at the end of the month.

The full project demonstates how to accept payments, manage recurring subscriptions, cancellations, metereing, and more. Watch the [App Tour](/courses/stripe-saas/project-tour/) video for a full breakdown of the project.


## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

<div class="box box-blue">
This course is intermediate level 🟦 and expects some familiarity with JavaScript and web development. The content is fast-paced and similar to my style on YouTube, but far more in-depth and should be followed in a linear format.

## How do I enroll?

The first few videos are *free*, so just give it try. When you reach a paid module, you will be asked to pay for a single course or upgrade to PRO.
