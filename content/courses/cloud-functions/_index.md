This course takes a hands-on approach to Firebase Cloud Functions where we build seven different microservices, each demonstrating a fundamental concept of the platform. Here's a quick summary of the topics you will learn.

- Serverless Computing Basics
- HTTP and ExpressJS
- Event-driven Background Functions
- Firestore Functions
- Storage Buckets and the Functions Filesystem
- Working with Google APIs
- Callable Functions and Authentication
- Working with 3rd party APIs like Twilio to send SMS Text messages
- By the end of this course you will have the foundation necessary to build virtually any Back-End feature into your Firebase app.

This Project is for Developers who... are building a mobile or web app with Firebase, want to learn how to build Back-End features in a serverless NodeJS Back-End and want direct access to the content creator (let's chat on Slack).  Experience Level Required - have at least some experience with JavaScript and programming fundamentals.  The course is fast-paced and content-rich, but most of the subject matter is suitable for developers with beginner JavaScript skills. It is expected that you're already familiar with Firebase because Cloud Functions are a way to extend the platform.

Brand New to Firebase?
If you've never used Firebase, start by working with the frontend SDKs before attempting Cloud Functions. The video below is a great way to get started:
