Zack is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-zack-derose">GDE for Google</a>, as well as an Engineer and Engineering Manager for <a href="http://nx.dev">Nx</a>, and an avid fan of <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>.

Zack always bets on Javascript (and Typescript), but he also enjoys Postgres, making videos, and has been dabbling recently in shit-posting on Twitter.
